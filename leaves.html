       <td><strong>Aloe Vera</strong></td>
       <td>To grow aloe vera, plant it in well-draining soil in a pot with a drainage hole,
         like a cactus mix, and place it in a bright location with direct sunlight. Water the
         plant only when the soil is completely dry, allowing excess water to drain away to prevent root rot.  </td>
       <td>Soothes burns & skin irritation</td>

     <tr>
        <td><strong>Mint</strong></td>
        <td>To grow mint, plant cuttings or established plants in pots to control its invasive spread, as 
          it thrives in containers with well-draining soil. Mint needs consistent moisture, so water regularly,
           but avoid overwatering. Provide it with a partly shady spot, especially in hot climates, to prevent scorched leaves.</td>
        <td>Relieves digestive discomfort</td>
        <td><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR08qSb0WVqjRXA-wGcjknImrmeIxGuS3kDRA&s" alt="Mint plant"></td>

     <tr>
        <td><strong>Lavender</strong></td>
        <td>To grow lavender successfully, plant it in a location with full sun and well-draining soil that is not overly fertile. 
          Water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot.</td>
        <td>Calming scent, aids relaxation</td>
        <td><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMG66w-nKDApYy1FNazmv3iV9U45J9iXefIg&s" alt="Lavender plant"></td>

     <tr>
        <td><strong>Chamomile</strong></td>
        <td>To grow chamomile, sow tiny seeds on the soil surface in a sunny location, providing moisture but no covering to allow 
          light for germination, and transplant them after the last frost. Chamomile prefers full sun, tolerates various soils, and needs 
          regular watering when young but becomes drought-tolerant once established.</td>
        <td>calming tea for stress and sleep.</td>
        <td><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQlouWqHcOl3Sk19Phr1h6614YETJAYhO5UnA&s" alt="Chamomile"></td> 
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Rosemary</strong></td>
        <td>To grow rosemary, choose a sunny spot and well-draining soil, as the plant hates wet roots. Start with cuttings from a mature plant, 
          rooting them in water or sandy potting mix. Plant them in the spring after the last frost, ensuring they receive 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. 
          Water regularly but allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. </td>
        <td>boosts memory, relieves headaches.</td>
        <td><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTpo8VxNhPrCBHGQsRLXU5Tfgw8XYLST5cxlQ&s" alt="Rosemary"></td>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Turmeric</strong></td>
        <td>To grow turmeric, prepare 1–3" rhizome pieces with buds, then let them dry for a day or two to prevent rot. Plant the pieces in well-draining,
           fertile soil (rich in compost) with the buds pointing upwards, 2–4" deep, and water well. Turmeric needs full sun or partial shade and consistently
           moist, but not wet, soil to thrive. </td>
        <td>anti-inflammatory, supports joint health.</td>
