        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>My website, Roots, is a space dedicated to exploring the healing power of plants, the wisdom of herbal remedies, and the sense of community that grows from shared knowledge. 
            The name Roots carries deep meaning for me as an African American, it reflects both my cultural ancestry and the literal roots of the earth that nourish life. It also symbolizes 
            growth, connection, and returning to where everything begins.</p>

        <p>The inspiration for this site came from learning about Hoodoo, an African American folk tradition that combines spirituality, healing, and herbal knowledge passed down through generations. 
          While Hoodoo is only an introduction to the website, it represents how I first discovered the importance of plants, not just as natural medicine, but as carriers of history and cultural memory.</p>

        <p>The layout of the site follows the symbolism of a tree. The Home page, called <a href="index.html">Roots</a>, grounds the website by sharing its purpose and inspiration. The Plants and Remedies page, called <a href="leaves.html">Leaves</a>, offers 
          information about different herbs, their uses, and how they connect to holistic healing. The Community page, known as <a href="branches.html">Branches</a>, is where people can come together, sharing experiences, tips, and stories about their own herbal journeys.</p>

        <p>Roots is more than a website, it’s a growing garden of knowledge and connection, where culture, community, and nature intertwine.

     <section class="history">

       <h2>History of Hoodoo</h2>
       <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(spirituality)">Hoodoo</a>,<i>“the indigenous, herbal, healing, and supernatural-controlling spiritual folk tradition,”</i> was born in America after the transatlantic 
        slave trade by enslaved African Americans seeking spiritual protection and healing. Hoodoo is made up of different dimensions and practitioners, 
        some being treaters, root workers, and midwives, who are widely overlooked. These practitioners, in particular, were herbal healers and mastered treatments, 
        becoming the pharmacists of their community or, in earlier cases, the plantation.</p>

        <p>The reason that this aspect of Hoodoo gets overlooked is that<i>“African Americans who know anything of contemporary Hoodoo will usually not immediately associate 
        it with medicinal herbalism.”</i> I believe this is because Hoodoo has been labeled by most as black magic, witchcraft, or demonic. However, this is not true. Contrary 
        to popular belief,<i>“Hoodoo tradition is not completely separate from the Black Christian church.”</i> You must remember that Hoodoo was created after the transatlantic slave
        trade, where the enslaved were forcibly taught Christianity. Therefore, you will see a lot of Christian traditions, including the Bible, in the practice.</p>

        <p>These beliefs, however, didn’t bury the tradition of Hoodoo completely, and certainly not the medicinal side.<i>“Much of Hoodoo’s medicinal herbalism would be kept 
        alive under another label. Home remedies were passed down—assuring that the post-emancipation African American community would inherit a well-developed and long-standing 
        folk medicine tradition.”</i></p>
